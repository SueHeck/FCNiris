For training you need original dataset images and groundtruth segmentation masks.

For images, download the dataset and place them in this folder. Make sure the path is:
[home]/data/images/[dataset_name]. For now, dataset_name is either CASIA4i or IITD.

For masks, make sure the path name is [home]/data/masks/[dataset_name]. Each dataset may have multiple groundtruth masks from different operators (operatorA and operatorB), we used operatorA.

CASIA4i:
Downloaded from: http://www.idealtest.org/dbDetailForUser.do?id=4
dataset: CASIA-Iris-Interval

IITD:
The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csajaykr/IITD/Database_Iris.htm).

The masks for CASIA4i and IITD are available [here](http://www.wavelab.at/sources/Hofbauer14b/).
